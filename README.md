# SLP-Intelligibility-of-Dysarthric-Speech
In this repository, the cleaned dataset and analysis code for the project "The reliability and validity of speech language pathologists' estimations of speech intelligibility in dysarthria" is provided. This project's main objective was to establish the reliability and validity of SLPs' intelligibility estimations of dysarthric speech. The results showed that the SLPs' intelligibility estimations were generally predictive of naive listener intelligibility. However, the interrater reliability for individual SLP ratings was moderate. All data cleaning and analyses were completed using R. These results were recently presented at the 2021 American Speech Language Hearing Association (ASHA) Convention and are currently in-preparation for publication. If you have any questions about the project or analyses, please contact either Micah Hirsch at mhirsch@fsu.edu or Austin Thompson at athompson4@fsu.edu.
